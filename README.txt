 Minetest mod: sneak_glitch
============================
This mod re-enables the sneak glitch in your Minetest world.
If you want to use the old sneak code, add the following setting
to your minetest.conf file:

  sneak_glitch.use_old_code = true

In case you used the ingame command `/set` to apply this change,
you will have to rejoin the world.
